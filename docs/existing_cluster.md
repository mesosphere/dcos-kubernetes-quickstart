# Existing Cluster

If you already have a DC/OS 1.11+ cluster, Kubernetes is publicly available in the Catalog.

Before proceeding, please ensure your cluster satisfies the minimum [resource requirements](https://docs.mesosphere.com/service-docs/kubernetes/1.0.1-1.9.4/install/#prerequisites/)

Then, install is as easy as:

```shell
$ dcos package install kubernetes
```

By default, it will provision a Kubernetes cluster with one (1) worker node, and
a single instance of every control plane component. To deploy a highly-available
cluster and three (3) worker nodes, run:

```shell
$ dcos package install --options=./resources/options-ha.json kubernetes
```
