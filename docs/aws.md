# AWS Cluster

The easiest way to get started on AWS is by setting environment variables with your access keys.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR ACCESS KEY>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR SECRET KEY>
```

Note that, you could experience some issues due to insufficient resource limits of your account. You can verify your default limits [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html).

You can then pass the platform variable to the `launch-dcos` command

```
make docker
# You are now in a container.
make launch-dcos PLATFORM=aws
# Launches DC/OS cluster. The cluster provisioning will take ~15 minutes.  
make setup-cli
# Configures the DC/OS CLI and kubectl.
make install
# Installs kubernetes on your cluster. Takes ~2 minutes.
make kubectl-tunnel PLATFORM=aws
# Creates a ssh tunnel to a node-agent for APIServer access.
# Make sure the API Server and Kubelets are up by running:

kubectl get nodes

# If you see a result like this, everything is working properly, and you are now running Kubernetes on DC/OS.

make uninstall
# Uninstalls kubernetes.
make destroy-dcos

```
```
