# Kubernetes on DC/OS

Kubernetes is now available as a DC/OS package to quickly, and reliably run Kubernetes clusters on Mesosphere DC/OS.

## Known limitations

Before proceeding, please check the [current package limitations](https://docs.mesosphere.com/service-docs/kubernetes/1.0.1-1.9.4/limitations/).

## Pre-Requisites

First, make sure your cluster fulfils the [Kubernetes package default requirements](https://docs.mesosphere.com/service-docs/kubernetes/1.0.1-1.9.4/install/#prerequisites/).

Then, check the requirements for running this quickstart:

* Linux or MacOS
* [Terraform 0.11.x](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). On MacOS, you can install with [brew](https://brew.sh/):
  ```bash
  $ brew install terraform
  ```
* [Google Cloud](docs/gcp.md), [AWS](docs/aws.md) or [Azure](docs/azure.md)
  account with enough permissions to provide the needed infrastructure

## Quickstart

Once the pre-requisites are met, clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:mesosphere/dcos-kubernetes-quickstart.git && cd dcos-kubernetes-quickstart
```

### Prepare infrastructure configuration

**This quickstart defaults to Google Cloud**

First, make sure you have have followed the [Google Cloud setup instructions](docs/gcp.md).

Then, start by generating the default infrastructure configuration:

```bash
$ make gcp
```

This will output sane defaults to `.deploy/desired_cluster_profile`.
Now, edit said file and set your `project-id` and the `gce_ssh_pub_key_file`
(the SSH public key you will use to log-in into your new VMs later).
Please, do not set a smaller instance (VM) type on the risk of failing to
install Kubernetes.

```
custom_dcos_download_path = "https://downloads.dcos.io/dcos/stable/1.11.0/dcos_generate_config.sh"
num_of_masters = "1"
num_of_private_agents = "3"
num_of_public_agents = "1"
#
gcp_project = "YOUR_GCP_PROJECT"
gcp_region = "us-central1"
gce_ssh_pub_key_file = "/PATH/YOUR_GCP_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY.pub"
#
gcp_bootstrap_instance_type = "n1-standard-1"
gcp_master_instance_type = "n1-standard-8"
gcp_agent_instance_type = "n1-standard-8"
gcp_public_agent_instance_type = "n1-standard-8"
# Inbound Master Access
admin_cidr = "0.0.0.0/0"
```

For more advanced scenarios, please check the [terraform-dcos documentation for Google Cloud](https://github.com/dcos/terraform-dcos/tree/master/gcp).

### Download command-line tools

If you haven't already, please download DC/OS client, `dcos` and Kubernetes
client, `kubectl`:

```bash
$ make get-cli
```

The `dcos` and `kubectl` binaries will be downloaded to the current workdir.
It's up to you to decided whether or not to copy or move them to another path,
e.g. a path included in `PATH`.

### Install

You are now ready to provision the DC/OS cluster and install the Kubernetes package:

```bash
$ make deploy
```

Terraform will now try and provision the infrastructure on your chosen cloud
provider, and then proceed to install DC/OS.

When DC/OS is up and running, the Kubernetes package installation will take place.

Wait until all tasks are running before trying to access the Kubernetes API.

You can watch the progress what was deployed so far with:

```bash
$ watch dcos kubernetes plan show deploy
```

Below is an example of how it looks like when the install ran successfully:

```
deploy (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)
   etcd (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)
      etcd-0:[peer] (COMPLETE)
   apiserver (parallel strategy) (COMPLETE)
      kube-apiserver-0:[instance] (COMPLETE)
   kubernetes-api-proxy (parallel strategy) (COMPLETE)
      kubernetes-api-proxy-0:[install] (COMPLETE)
   controller-manager (parallel strategy) (COMPLETE)
      kube-controller-manager-0:[instance] (COMPLETE)
   scheduler (parallel strategy) (COMPLETE)
      kube-scheduler-0:[instance] (COMPLETE)
   node (parallel strategy) (COMPLETE)
      kube-node-0:[kube-proxy] (COMPLETE)
      kube-node-0:[coredns] (COMPLETE)
      kube-node-0:[kubelet] (COMPLETE)
   public-node (parallel strategy) (COMPLETE)
      kube-node-public-0:[kube-proxy] (COMPLETE)
      kube-node-public-0:[coredns] (COMPLETE)
      kube-node-public-0:[kubelet] (COMPLETE)
   mandatory-addons (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)
      mandatory-addons-0:[kube-dns] (COMPLETE)
      mandatory-addons-0:[metrics-server] (COMPLETE)
      mandatory-addons-0:[dashboard] (COMPLETE)
      mandatory-addons-0:[ark] (COMPLETE)
```

### Accessing the DC/OS Dashboard

You can access DC/OS Dashboard and check Kubernetes package tasks under Services:

```bash
$ make ui
```

### Accessing the Kubernetes API

In order to access the Kubernetes API from outside the DC/OS cluster, one needs
to configure `kubectl`, the Kubernetes CLI tool:

```bash
$ make kubectl-config
```

Let's test accessing the Kubernetes API and list the Kubernetes cluster nodes:

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                                          STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
kube-node-0-kubelet.kubernetes.mesos          Ready     <none>    8m        v1.9.4
kube-node-1-kubelet.kubernetes.mesos          Ready     <none>    8m        v1.9.4
kube-node-2-kubelet.kubernetes.mesos          Ready     <none>    8m        v1.9.4
kube-node-public-0-kubelet.kubernetes.mesos   Ready     <none>    7m        v1.9.4
```

### Using kubectl proxy

For running more advanced commands such as `kubectl proxy`, an SSH tunnel is still required.
To create the tunnel, run:

```bash
$ make kubectl-tunnel
```

If `kubectl` is properly configured and the tunnel established successfully, in another terminal you should now be able to run `kubectl proxy` as well as any other command.

## Uninstall Kubernetes

To uninstall the DC/OS Kubernetes package while leaving your DC/OS cluster up,
run:

```bash
$ make uninstall
```

**NOTE:** This will only uninstall Kubernetes. Make sure you destroy your DC/OS
cluster using the instructions below when you finish testing, or otherwise you
will need to delete all cloud resources manually!

## Destroy cluster

To destroy the whole deployment:

```bash
$ make destroy
```

Last, clean generated resources:
```
make clean
```
